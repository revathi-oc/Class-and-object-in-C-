# Class and object in C++
## Aim
To learn about classes and objects in C++.

## Theory
In C++, a **class** is a blueprint for creating objects, which represent entities with attributes (data) and behaviors (functions). A class encapsulates data and the functions that operate on that data, promoting the principles of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, such as **encapsulation**, **abstraction**, and **modularity**. It defines variables (known as **data members**) and functions (known as **member functions** or **methods**) that describe the characteristics and actions of the object.

An **object** is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created. Objects are used to access and manipulate the data and methods within the class. For example, if a class named `Car` is defined, an object like `myCar` can be created to represent a specific car with its own data (e.g., brand, color) and behaviors (e.g., accelerate, brake).

Classes support key OOP features like **inheritance** (enabling a new class to derive properties from an existing one), **polymorphism** (allowing different classes to be treated uniformly), and **encapsulation** (hiding internal details from the outside). Overall, classes and objects provide structure and reusability in C++ programs, allowing for more organized and maintainable code.
